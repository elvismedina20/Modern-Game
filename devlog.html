      <h2>✅ Changes We Made</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>We modernized the 2015 “A Web Game in an Hour” project using ES6+ JavaScript and modular file structure.</li>
        <li>Created a total of four different site versions during the process — lots of trial and error.</li>
        <li>Reorganized the original code into separate files for easier readability and debugging.</li>
        <li>Upgraded the visual style from plain and dull to a more game-like, immersive design.</li>
        <li>Tested the code on a temporary site to confirm everything worked before deploying it to the final website.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>⚠️ Challenges We Faced</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>It was difficult to break down and understand the original code due to lack of structure and outdated syntax.</li>
        <li>One bug had us stuck — the “Start Game” button wasn’t working because of a one-letter typo in the command.</li>
        <li>Finals week made scheduling and progress tough — finding time to meet and collaborate was a challenge.</li>
        <li>Sorting out which code belonged in which file was a slow and sometimes frustrating process.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>🤝 How We Worked Together</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>We met in person twice but coordinated mostly through GroupMe to stay on track and assign tasks.</li>
        <li><strong>Framber Rodriguez</strong> focused on the core game logic, modular code structure, and bug fixes.</li>
        <li><strong>Elvis Medina</strong> handled the visual design, HTML/CSS structure, integration, and documentation.</li>
        <li>We both reviewed each other’s work to make sure the project stayed clean, functional, and visually consistent.</li>
      </ul>
