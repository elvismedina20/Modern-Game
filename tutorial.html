    // 🧱 Foundation
    // This part of the code builds the foundation of the Pong game.
    // It sets the size and speed of the paddles and ball, keeps track of the score,
    // checks if the game is running, and prepares everything needed for the game to start.
    // It also sets up the controls, tracks who’s playing, and gets things ready for smooth movement,
    // scoring, and winning. Think of it as the behind-the-scenes setup that makes the game work once you hit "play." 🎮⚙️

    // Placeholder for actual JavaScript code
    console.log("Game foundation setup");
