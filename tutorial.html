    <h1>Pong Game Tutorial(Updated)</h1>

  <h1>üèì Welcome to the Classic Pong Game Tutorial!</h1>
  <p>
    Brought to you by <strong>Elvis Medina</strong> and <strong>Framber Rodriguez</strong>!
  </p>

  <p>
    In this step-by-step guide, you‚Äôll learn how to create one of the most legendary arcade games ever made‚Äî<strong>Pong</strong>‚Äîusing <code>HTML5</code>, <code>CSS</code>, and <code>JavaScript</code>.
    This tutorial is designed with beginners in mind, making it perfect if you're just starting out with game development or looking to sharpen your coding skills.
  </p>

  <p>
    Together, we'll walk you through building a fully playable Pong game from scratch.
    You'll learn how to:
    <ul>
      <li>Draw game elements with the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element</li>
      <li>Control paddle movement with keyboard input</li>
      <li>Detect collisions and keep score</li>
      <li>Add fun extras like animations and sound effects</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    By the time you're done, not only will you have a finished game to show off‚Äî
    you‚Äôll also have a solid foundation in <strong>JavaScript game development</strong>.
  </p>

  <p><em>Let‚Äôs dive in and start coding!</em> üíªüî•</p>

    <h3>üß± Foundation</h3>
    <p>
      This part of the code builds the foundation of the Pong game.
      It sets the size and speed of the paddles and ball, keeps track of the score,
      checks if the game is running, and prepares everything needed for the game to start.
      It also sets up the controls, tracks who‚Äôs playing, and gets things ready for smooth movement,
      scoring, and winning. Think of it as the behind-the-scenes setup that makes the game work once you hit "play." üéÆ‚öôÔ∏è
    </p>

    <h3>üìÑ JavaScript Setup Code:</h3>
    <pre><code>
// --- Game Constants --- 
const PADDLE_HEIGHT = 100; 
const PADDLE_WIDTH = 15; 
const BALL_SIZE = 15;

const PLAYER_SPEED = 6;

const INITIAL_BALL_SPEED = 5; 
const BALL_SPEED_INCREASE = 0.2;

  <h2>üéÆ Player Class: Paddle Power</h2>
  <p>The Player class defines how each player's paddle operates. It sets the size, speed, and movement rules, giving each player a unique gameplay experience. Player 1 and Player 2 can be controlled using the keyboard, or one can be AI-controlled depending on the game mode. It also includes logic for firing the ball into play when the spacebar is pressed, adding an extra layer of control for the players. Think of this as giving each paddle its own brain and personality! üß†üïπÔ∏è</p>

  <h2>ü§ñ AI Class: Mastering the Paddle</h2>
  <p>The AI class defines how the computer-controlled paddle behaves in the game. It‚Äôs like programming the AI's "brain" to play pong! The AI predicts the ball‚Äôs movement, adjusts its speed, and decides when to react. Depending on the selected difficulty level, the AI‚Äôs reaction time, speed, and prediction accuracy change, making it either a formidable opponent or a beginner-level challenge. It‚Äôs all about making the AI feel as smart as a real player! ‚ö°Ô∏è</p>

  <h2>üéÆ Ball Class: Movement, Reset, and Visual Updates</h2>
  <p>The Ball class is responsible for everything related to the ball‚Äôs behavior. It takes care of the ball's starting position, its movement across the screen, and the bouncing logic when it hits the walls or paddles. Additionally, it ensures that the ball's position is correctly synced with its on-screen representation, allowing for smooth gameplay. Whether it's traveling across the screen or resetting after a point is scored, this class makes sure the ball behaves just like you'd expect in a real pong game! ‚öΩÔ∏èüí®</p>

  <h2>üéÆ Game Functions</h2>

  <section>
  <h3>1. Change Difficulty üéÆ</h3>
  <p>This function adjusts the difficulty of the AI opponent based on the selected value. It‚Äôs a handy way to tweak the challenge and keep the game exciting, but it only applies in 1-player mode. Whether you're looking for an easy match or a tough challenge, this feature lets you control the level of intensity! ‚öôÔ∏è</p>

  <p>This function updates the score display on the page, keeping track of the current score for Player 1 and Player 2.

Every collision is an opportunity for the ball to speed up, adding intensity and challenge to each round! üí•</p>

  <h3>4. Check Scored üèÜ</h3>
  <p>This function checks if a player has scored a point. When a point is scored, it updates the score, checks for a winner, and resets the ball if needed to start the next round. It‚Äôs a crucial part of keeping the game flowing smoothly and ensuring that the winner is always determined by the gameplay. Every time the ball crosses the goal line, it triggers a reset and brings excitement to the next round! ‚öΩÔ∏è</p>

  <h2>Wrapping Up üéÆ</h2>
  <p>Congratulations! You've just created a fully functional Web game that works seamlessly across PCs, smartphones, and tablets. üéâ While it's ready to play, there‚Äôs always room for improvement and fine-tuning. For instance, on smartphones, the game might feel a bit cramped in portrait mode, so be sure to flip it into landscape orientation for a smoother experience. This game is just the beginning‚Äîthink of it as a sneak peek into the endless possibilities of Web-based game development. The best part? The journey doesn‚Äôt end here! There‚Äôs always more room to level up, get creative, and expand on your project. Keep pushing the boundaries and let your imagination run wild. üöÄ</p>
