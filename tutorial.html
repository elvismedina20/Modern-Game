    <h1>Pong Game Foundation Setup</h1>
    <h3>üß± Foundation</h3>
    <p>
      This part of the code builds the foundation of the Pong game.
      It sets the size and speed of the paddles and ball, keeps track of the score,
      checks if the game is running, and prepares everything needed for the game to start.
      It also sets up the controls, tracks who‚Äôs playing, and gets things ready for smooth movement,
      scoring, and winning. Think of it as the behind-the-scenes setup that makes the game work once you hit "play." üéÆ‚öôÔ∏è
