  <h1>üèì Welcome to the Classic Pong Game Tutorial!</h1>
  <p>
    Brought to you by <strong>Elvis Medina</strong> and <strong>Framber Rodriguez</strong>!
  </p>

  <p>
    In this step-by-step guide, you‚Äôll learn how to create one of the most legendary arcade games ever made‚Äî<strong>Pong</strong>‚Äîusing <code>HTML5</code>, <code>CSS</code>, and <code>JavaScript</code>.
    This tutorial is designed with beginners in mind, making it perfect if you're just starting out with game development or looking to sharpen your coding skills.
  </p>

  <p>
    Together, we'll walk you through building a fully playable Pong game from scratch.
    You'll learn how to:
    <ul>
      <li>Draw game elements with the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element</li>
      <li>Control paddle movement with keyboard input</li>
      <li>Detect collisions and keep score</li>
      <li>Add fun extras like animations and sound effects</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    By the time you're done, not only will you have a finished game to show off‚Äî
    you‚Äôll also have a solid foundation in <strong>JavaScript game development</strong>.
  </p>

  <p><em>Let‚Äôs dive in and start coding!</em> üíªüî•</p>

    <h3>üß± Foundation</h3>
    <p>
      This part of the code builds the foundation of the Pong game.
      It sets the size and speed of the paddles and ball, keeps track of the score,
      checks if the game is running, and prepares everything needed for the game to start.
      It also sets up the controls, tracks who‚Äôs playing, and gets things ready for smooth movement,
      scoring, and winning. Think of it as the behind-the-scenes setup that makes the game work once you hit "play." üéÆ‚öôÔ∏è
    </p>

    <h3>üìÑ JavaScript Setup Code:</h3>
    <pre><code>
// --- Game Constants --- 
const PADDLE_HEIGHT = 100; 
const PADDLE_WIDTH = 15; 
const BALL_SIZE = 15;

const PLAYER_SPEED = 6; 
const MAX_BOUNCE_ANGLE = Math.PI / 4;

const INITIAL_BALL_SPEED = 5; 
const BALL_SPEED_INCREASE = 0.2;

const WIN_PARTICLE_COUNT = 40;

// --- Game State ---
let player1, player2, ball, ai;
let score = [0, 0]; 
let lastUpdate = 0; 
let gameRunning = false;

let ballPossessionOnScore = true; 
let keysPressed = {};

let currentBallSpeed = INITIAL_BALL_SPEED; 
let gameMode = '1p';

let winScoreLimit = 10; 
let pointsPerScoreValue = 1;

let animationFrameId = null; 
let framesSinceStart = 0;

let lastScoreState = null;

// --- Basic Element Check ---
if (!game || !player1El || !player2El || !ballEl || !controlsEl || !startButton || 
    !resetButton || !undoButton || !toggleMusicButton || !fullscreenButton || 
    !musicSelect || !backgroundMusic || !homepageSection ||

    return;
}

  <h2>üéÆ Player Class</h2>
  <p>This part of the code defines how each player paddle works. It sets their size, speed, and movement rules. Player 1 and Player 2 can be controlled by the keyboard, or one can be an AI. It also includes logic for firing the ball into play when the spacebar is pressed. Think of this as giving each paddle its brain and personality. üß†üïπÔ∏è</p>
