      <h2>🧩 Project Overview</h2>
      <p>This project was based on the task of updating the original 2015 "A Web Game in an Hour" tutorial to meet modern web standards. The goal was to refactor the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so that the game runs smoothly in today's browsers, using ES6+ syntax, modular file structure, and responsive design.</p>
      <p>After rebuilding the game logic and interface, we collaborated to create a simple website that showcases the final product. Free tools like GitHub Pages and onlinegdb.com were explored for use and testing. The result is a website that shows the 3 different buttons devlog, play and home, which are all funtional.</p>
